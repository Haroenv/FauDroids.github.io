This is a loosely organized list of potential Android app ideas, their
intentions and target groups.


### The Fruit-Ripeness-Meter

Buying ripe fruit in a supermarkt can be a real hassle for red-green color
blind people. For example choosing a banana that is ready to eat is
difficult, as the difference between an unripe green banana and a ripe yellow
one is sometimes very subtle, making it hard to spot a good banana with the
bare eye.

This app will help red-green color bling people by allowing them to take a
picture of their fruit and getting told whether or not it is ripe. 


### Peer to Peer Messenger 

Popular mobile chatting apps all require backends to deliver messages to their
receivers. This is less than ideal when considering privacy or when being
caught in a place with little or no network coverage.

By using a peer to peer messenger we could send message between devices without
letting anyone else every know about what just happened. While it might take a
little longer for a message to propagate to its destintation, it could serve as
a valuable addition to existing apps.


### The Distributed Evolution Game

Nowadays virtually everyone you meet has a powerful smartphone right in their
pocket and we tend to meet a lot of different people over the day. What if we
would build a game that would trigger some sort of interaction whenever two
(new) people meet?

In the Distributed Evolution Game everyone has some sort of personal animal /
monster / pet is living inside smartphones (Tamagotchi anyone?) which can
evolve over time by exchanging DNA with other people. If done frequently enough
this would lead to a diverse set of creates which all have different abilities
and could then compete with one another in various challenges.


### Electronic organ donor card

        Organ or tissue transplantation can give ill and disabled people the
        chance of a new or better life. The prerequisite is, and always will be,
        that people continue to express their willingness to donate organs and/
        or tissue after their death. We would therefore ask you to think about
        the subject of organ and tissue donation and then reach your own,
        personal decision. &mdash; Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung

As you just read, donating organs may save other peoples lifes. Since organ donation prerequisits you to carry an organ donor card with you, I came up with the idea to provide an electronic pendant to the classic printed version. 

Since most people own a smartphone, which they happen to carry with them almost all the time, it would be great to have an organ donor app which provides a lockscreen widget. Using this widget it would be possible to view the organ donor card even if the smartphone is locked.
