This is a loosely organized list of potential Android app ideas, their
intentions and target groups.


### The Fruit-Ripeness-Meter

Buying ripe fruit in a supermarkt can be a real hassle for red-green color
blind people. For example choosing a banana that is ready to eat is
difficult, as the difference between an unripe green banana and a ripe yellow
one is sometimes very subtle, making it hard to spot a good banana with the
bare eye.

This app will help red-green color bling people by allowing them to take a
picture of their fruit and getting told whether or not it is ripe. 


### Peer to peer messenger 

Popular mobile chatting apps all require backends to deliver messages to their
receivers. This is less than ideal when considering privacy or when being
caught in a place with little or no network coverage.

By using a peer to peer messenger we could send message between devices without
letting anyone else every know about what just happened. While it might take a
little longer for a message to propagate to its destintation, it could serve as
a valuable addition to existing apps.
