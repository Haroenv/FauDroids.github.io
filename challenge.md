Borrowed from the famous one game a month challenge, we'll develop and release
one Android app every month for the next 12 months. 

## Rules

TODO

1. The App has to be released (e.g. Google Play Store) at the end of each month with an optional  *48 hours extension* to the deadline
2. The App can be about pretty much anything
3. Anything else?
