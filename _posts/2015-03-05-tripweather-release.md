Slightly behind schedule but still within reason, our app for February has been
released! As promised it's all about getting weather forecasts for longer
trips, without the hassel of having to enter multiple locations and
corresponding times when one expects to be there. Instead, just provide the
trip's start and end location and what time you would like to leave and
TripWeather generates some nice graphs showing the expected temperature, rain
and snow for that trip.
