Imagine a motion based game which could make you feel the tension and thrill inside a boxing ring.

*You sneak up on your opponent, throwing some  jabs, waiting for the perfect moment to place your feared uppercut. Once your opponent hit the ground you receive your championship belt and become the newest member in the hall of fame of boxing.*

Well, that's how it could be... But if you only want to enjoy some sparring rounds, without the need of getting your nose put back into the right place, you could play a round of BoxClub.

By utilizing the built-in sensors of a typical Android phone we try to recreate the movement of a boxer. You will be able to throw punches by rotating your phone, take cover by tilting it to the back and maybe even more.

Sounds fun? Definitely! So stay tuned for updates!
