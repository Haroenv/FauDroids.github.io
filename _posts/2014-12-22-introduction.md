<strong>The Android Challenge</strong> is a personal project where we will
build and release <em>one Android app each month for the next 12 months</em>.
There are no real restrictions on the kind of app or their scope, so we will
mostly focues on what interests us personally and things that are fun to build
:)


## Rules

There are no rules.

Well, note quite. Foremost and above all we are doing this to have fun. But as
personal projects usually go it's very difficult to keep at it for longer
periods of time. That's why we came up with this challenge and have limited the
active development time of one app to one month only. Check out a detailed
description at the [challenges page]({{ site.baseurl }}/challenge).

## Ideas

[Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/ideas)  you can find an overview of our current ideas
and their progress.  If you have an idea of your own or want to comment on one
of the exisiting ones be sure to drop us a note (TODO where?? Comments, mail?)

## Team

We are a small team of students that are living and studying in Germany. If you
