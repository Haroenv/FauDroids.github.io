So, another month comes to an end and we're working on our third app, BoxClub.

Since March has been pretty packed with exams and we also wanted to enjoy some spare time, we've got a pretty tough schedule. Our last exam took place on March 23rd, leaving us with a time slot of only 10 days to come up with a cool game.

## Our story starts on March, 24th...

### Motion control

We met at the university to do some brainstorming, hoping to come up with something useful. Our initial requirements were quite simple: A motion-controlled boxing game in landscape mode, that's it.
Next, we decided on possible game motions.
It should be possible to throw punches by rotating the phone around its x-axis.

Sounds good in theory, but it turned out that one almost drops his phone to the ground when fighting too hard. So let's go for rotation around the z-axis, similar to a steering wheel. <strong>Aaaaah, much better!</strong>

Implementing rotation detection also went pretty well and so we soon printed our first motion-generated debug output.
After we cleared this first hurdle we came up with the idea that it would be nice to dodge your opponents fists by really ducking under it. 

That's where the not so fun part about motion sensors began. 
Unfortunately the accelerometer was a bit inaccurate and also generated noisy data, which resulted in absolutely unusable motion estimates. It was not even possible to accurately generate a binary value ducked / not ducked, which caused a bit of a headache until we finally decided to dump the idea of literally ducking ourselfes under our opponents fists of steel. 

Another thougt was to utilize the built-in light sensor such that one would've to pull the device towards the body in order to block an attack. But we didn't spend much time on that one and went for the third idea, which now blocks an attack by swiping the screen. It's accurate and won't mess up the rotation measures.

### Graphics

Ok, so we decided on how to control the game, but do you think a boxing game based on debug messages is any fun? - <strong>No!</strong>

We were in need of some decent graphics and a game layout - time to smear on a blackboard!

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_blackboard_2.jpg" alt="Blackboard smearings"></td><td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_blackboard_1.jpg" alt="Blackboard smearings"</img></td>
    </tr>
</table>

A layout was soon to be found, but our initial set of graphics was rather clumsy. Fortunately Philipp turned out to be quite a graphics guy and so he converted our edgy sketches into a beatiful image set.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_screen_1.png" alt="Graphics in the making"></td><td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_screen_2.png" alt="Graphics in the making"</img></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_screen_3.png" alt="Graphics in the making"></td><td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_screen_4.png" alt="Graphics in the making"</img></td>
    </tr>
</table>

And that's how BoxClub looks like at the very moment:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_1.png" alt="BoxClub latest"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_2.png" alt="BoxClub latest"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/imgs/boxclub/boxclub_3.png" alt="BoxClub latest"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
