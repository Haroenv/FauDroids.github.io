... and we are already close to the end of January. 

We are planning to do a little 'hackathon' on the upcoming weekend to get our first release candidate done, but as far as it looks by now it should be possible. 
At least we hope so :)

<!--We are already able to play a game on several devices, all connected to a (for now) dedicated host, which is the main part of our game. He handles the game logic, communicates with all clients, manages players and their points and finally determines the winner!-->

By now we have implemented a basic game logic, a fully functional UI (even with cool flip animations!) and set up the network communication (there are still some things to do, but we're working on it), which allows us to play some test games. 
Additionally,  at least as far as I can tell, we are managing a well structured code base. 

The latter was mainly Philipps work, since I'm a total newbie in the field of Android development.
Vice versa this means that these are perfect conditions for me to learn tons of new things! :)

That's it for now, we'll be back when our first app is ready to hit the Play store!
