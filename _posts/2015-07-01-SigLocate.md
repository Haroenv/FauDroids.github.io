###O Brother, where art thou? 

Some days ago we've released our June's app, which is a handy tool for your everyday life at the University. 

With **SigLocate** it's possible to mark your current position at the SÃ¼dmensa Erlangen in order to share this info with your friends.

Once you've pinned your location you can share a picture of this map via your preferred messenger. And if it's supported by the messenger, it's even possible to add a message to it. ggjjhgghjh

It's simple, it's fast and it's on Google Play, so feel free to use it!
