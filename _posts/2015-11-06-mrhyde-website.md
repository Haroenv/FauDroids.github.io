While searching for a new app idea for June (which turns out to be a lot harder than we thought), we spent some time building a website for MrHyde. 

Check it out [http://faudroids.org/MrHyde/](http://faudroids.org/MrHyde/)

The site is built using Bootstrap and hosted on GitHub. I have personally never built a website before, but looking at the final result it might be time to give our regular webpage a new look. Bootstrap just makes it too easy to build awesome stuff quickly.
