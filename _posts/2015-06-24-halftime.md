<strong>We're halfway to the top!</strong><br>
We're approaching the end of June, so half a year is soon to be completed! 
</cite>
</div>

And even though it's already that late, we're still working on and improving MrHyde. <small>He's quite an evil person, so we better don't mess around with him...</small>

Anyways, the next major update is just about to be shipped and it'll include some general enhancements, as well as some new editor features. 

At the same time we're also working on some improvements to our preview server in order to make new things possible. 

If this sounds good to you and you also have some additional ideas, just drop us a note or file a pull request, we'd love to hear from you! 

But this wouldn't be the Android Challenge if there wouldn't be another app. This time it's all about our daily business at the University, making appointments for lunch.

It's always quite cumbersome to precisely describe your fellow students where exactly one is sitting (or hiding) in the canteen.
So we decided to build an app which let's you mark your exact location on a map of our canteen, so you can share a detailed description of your location. 

Hopefully this will make it a bit easier to find your friends without the need for phone calls, mails, etc.
