If you can read this you're seeing the result of our latest app. I'm writing this blog post whilst sitting in the back of a car on my way home from a trip to Prague. 

We're using github pages to host our blog, but we've always been a bit unhappy with the fact that there is no mobile client for such a setup.
So we decided to create a client/server based service which allows one to write blog posts on the go, view previews in a dynamic "scratchpad" and finally publish the new content. 

There will be a separate blog post explaining the details of our service as well as it's setup, so keep your eyes open, it might be online by tomorrow!
