It's on! We've chosen our first project and already begun to work on it, so at the end of january you will be able to get a glance at our first app, a distributed memory game.

The distributed memory game creates one big playing field by connecting and synchronizing several smartphone displays, allowing you to increase the total amount of cards and players to get even more out of this fun game.

## Game modes:

### Normal mode

The classical memory game as it should be known to everyone. Simply try to collect as much pairs as possible to outrun your opponents!

### Versus mode

To be continued ...
