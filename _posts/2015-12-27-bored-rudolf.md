Christmas time is (still) here and what would be better than to give your app a
slight holiday touch? Of course you could simply add falling snowflakes and add
some light bells in the background, but that's old school. How about replacing
your standard pull-to-refresh layout with something a little more fun? 

Bored Rudolf is a small Android library which puts a fun little game inside the
pull-to-refresh layout, which makes waiting for whatever work is being done in
the background, so much more enjoyable. Like everything else the library is
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/faudroids/bored-rudolf). There's also
a little preview on YouTube if you are curious ;)
