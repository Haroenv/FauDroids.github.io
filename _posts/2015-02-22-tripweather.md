Turns out that writing exams, going to work, having a short month and wanting
to build an awesome app don't mix very well. Well, who would have thought that? :D

Anyways, it's time to get some movement into this month's project, which will
be all about [weather forecasts for trips]({{ site.baseurl }}/ideas#tripweather).

For now we have opted for using [openweather.org](http://openweathermap.org) to
fetch weather data and the [Google Places
Api](https://developers.google.com/places/) for getting geo related data. Eventually
we'll look into integrating the Google Maps Api as well, but for now we are working
on getting the forecast logic right.

And in case you were wondering that the weather is like right now, take a look at our current app progress:
