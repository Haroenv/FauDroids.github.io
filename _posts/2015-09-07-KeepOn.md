Each year the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, the TUM (Technische Universität
München) and the University of Stuttgart do a two week long summer course
called ["Ferienakademie"](http://www.ferienakademie.de/2014/kurse.html) (summer
academy) in [Sarntal,
Italy](https://www.google.de/maps/place/39058+Sarentino+BZ,+Italy/@46.6426004,11.3555186,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4782a156ff5b1f57:0x362e23c1538ebf54).
Over those two weeks students give presentations (usually of technical or
scientific nature), build all kinds of prototypes and generally do a fair
amount of hiking.  When Julia and I attended the Ferienakademie in 2014, we
worked on an Android App called *nEVERrEST* (unfortunately we didn't get around
to publish the app since most time went into discussing and designing the
concepts behind in), which tries to motivate people to do sports by letting
them work on challenges in groups (think gamification combined with Sports).
Example challenges included climbing the Mount Everest (hence the title) by
combining the differences in altitude people conquered during their regular
climbing exercises. Alone this would take quite a while (8,848 m in total!) but
if multiple people work on it together it becomes manageable.

Since we have never stopped believing in the concept behind nEVERrEST and
because there really isn't any application quite like that, we decided to
create
[KeepOn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.faudroids.keepon).
KeepOn is a small demo which showcases how combining challenges with sports
could look like. Since one month just wasn't enough, especially because July is
typically full of exams and university project deadlines, KeepOn is more of a
prototype with singleplayer support only at the moment.  Nevertheless it
supports basic recording of running sessions, attaching those sessions to
challenges and tracking the progress of various challenges.

If this has made you curious check out the app on the
[playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.faudroids.keepon)
and take a look at some of the screenshots below. We also love
[feedback](mailto:ideas@faudroids.org), be it on the app design or on the
concept itself, comments are always welcome.
