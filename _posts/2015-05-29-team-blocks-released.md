Team Blocks: a classical blocks game with a multiplayer twist.
</cite></div>

Totally unlike ourselves we managed to release this month's app 4 days early. 4 days!! 

After a rather complex setup with MrHyde, we decided to do something just a little simpler this time, which is why we choose to open up the box of classical arcade games and see if we could do a remake with a slightly different game play. Three weeks later Team Blocks was born, a multiplayer version of the classical game we all know and love where bricks fall down from above (not sure if we are allowed to mention the evil T word here ...).

Anyways, if you thought that the original was hard, you have not tried Team Blocks. Once you get over the initial color flash (your blocks are blue, your fiends are yellow, and together you turn green) you'll soon realize that each mistake is incredibly hard to get rid of later on (unless of course your name is Julia or Stefan and you just rock at the game. Highscore of over 1700?!? I still can't believe it :D).

So long story short, Team Blocks is out, it's awesome, download it and send us a game invite if you feel like challenging one of us!
