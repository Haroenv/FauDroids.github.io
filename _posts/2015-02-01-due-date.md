## That's it, January is over!

After spending a weekend on coding, testing and fast food, we're quite happy with the results.
We spent some effort onto graphics and UI, refurbished layouts and did some testing and bug fixing.

There are small things left to fix (first month and already extending the deadline :) ), but our first app "Flippy Pairs", a memory game which is played on several connected smartphones or tablets, is approaching its finalization and will soon be available via Play store.

### So, first month, first app, time for a first conclusion!

1: It's tons of fun! Even if it may sound boring to you, we (and some others) always had a good laugh when developing and testing our app.

2: It was more work than we expected. When we started out we didn't expect we would end up with such a large codebase, but as mentioned in the last post it's a well structured codebase, so it's not that hard to maintain.

3: **We want you!**

When we were thinking about which app to develop in February, we realized we need more ideas.
So if you come up with a cool idea, please tell us! 

Don't hesitate to get in contact with us, simply write a mail to <a href="mailto:ideas@faudroids.org>ideas@faudroids.org</a>.

That's it, see you next time!
