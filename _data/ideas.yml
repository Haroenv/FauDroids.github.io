  content: |+
      Buying ripe fruit in a supermarkt can be a real hassle for red-green color
      blind people. For example choosing a banana that is ready to eat is
      difficult, as the difference between an unripe green banana and a ripe
      yellow one is sometimes very subtle, making it hard to spot a good banana
      with the bare eye.
      
      This app will help red-green color blind people by allowing them to take a
      picture of their fruit and getting told whether or not it is ripe.

      Popular mobile chatting apps all require backends to deliver messages to
      their receivers. This is less than ideal when considering privacy or when
      being caught in a place with little or no network coverage.
      
      By using a peer to peer messenger we could send message between devices
      without letting anyone else every know about what just happened. While it
      might take a little longer for a message to propagate to its destintation,
      it could serve as a valuable addition to existing apps.

      Nowadays virtually everyone you meet has a powerful smartphone right in
      their pocket and we tend to meet a lot of different people over the day.
      What if we would build a game that would trigger some sort of interaction
      whenever two (new) people meet?
      
      In the Distributed Evolution Game everyone has some sort of personal animal
      / monster / pet is living inside smartphones (Tamagotchi anyone?) which can
      evolve over time by exchanging DNA with other people. If done frequently
      enough this would lead to a diverse set of creates which all have different
      abilities and could then compete with one another in various challenges.

      Organ or tissue transplantation can give ill and disabled people the
      chance of a new or better life. The prerequisite is, and always will be,
      that people continue to express their willingness to donate organs and/
      or tissue after their death. We would therefore ask you to think about
      the subject of organ and tissue donation and then reach your own,
      personal decision. &mdash; Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung

      As you just read, donating organs may save other people's lifes. Since organ
      donation prerequisites you to carry an organ donor card with you, I came up
      with the idea to provide an electronic pendant to the classic printed version. 
      
      Since most people own a smartphone, which they happen to carry with them almost
      all the time, it would be great to have an organ donor app which provides a
      lockscreen widget. Using this widget it would be possible to view the organ
      donor card even if the smartphone is locked.

  title: Smartphone Orchestra
  content: |+
      This is less on the useful and more on the fun / geeky side: imaging
      hooking up multiple smartphones in such a way that they together play a
      tune or song. With a lot of phones connected this could result in a setup
      similar to a real life orchestra where each phone is responsible for
      playing certain notes.

      Another possible way to look at this idea is to simulate a surround sound
      system using multiple phones. While probably not being a replacement for
      a real sound system, it could be a fun party trick with many people
      involved.

      Have you ever wanted to share your current audio / music stream that you
      are listening with people that are in the same network but couldn't
      because there wasn't a link to share? Well, why don't we just forward your audio stream
      directly to your friends?

      This app allows users to create a distributed speaker system, where one
      client controls what music is currently playing and all other phones act
      as speakers which can be spread across multiple rooms.

      Want to play memory with your kids or friends but don't have any suitable
      cards with you? No problem! Just put your and your friends' phones on the
      table and open the memory app. Depending on the screensize each phone
      will display the backside of a number of cards which you can tap to open.

  title: Personal Time Tracker (NFC)
  content: |+
      Keeping an eye on your total time spent on a subject isn't always easy. 
      Using NFC tags this job could be made much easier.

      Utilizing your mobile as a stamp card you could check-in whenever you start 
      working on a subject by simply placing it on top of an NFC tag.
      As soon as you lift your mobile off the tag, the elapsed time gets measured and stored, 
      giving you an exact overview on how long you've been working on something.

      NOTE: This app requires additional hardware in form of NFC tags.

- name: tripweather
  title: Weather forecast for a trip
  packageName: org.faudroids.tripweather
  content: |+
      Have you ever wondered how the weather might evolve while you are
      planning for a trip? Regular weather forecasts are great, but limited in
      a sense that they only provide data for one location, so getting
      forecasts for a long trip which might take more than one day is a very
      cumbersome and dull task.

      This app will show you the weather forecast along a route that you can
      choose. In addition all weather details will be based on the estimated
      time when you will have reached a particular checkpoint. No more manually
      entering multiple locations with different times!

- name: conveyor_belts
  title: Conveyor belts
  content: |+
      Everyone loves conveyor belts (I know you do too) and it's fun watching
      stuff moving through a complicated maze before it reaches its
      destination. And it only get's better when adding the ability to change
      parts of the maze and dictate where that stuff is actually going.

      This app will do just that, either in the context of an airport where
      bags need to be forwarded to the right plane, or in the form of a sushi
      restaurant where food should go to the customer who ordered it.

      If time permits this game could also be played by combining multiple
      screens (think people seeing different parts of the airport or the
      restaurant).

      a real boxing match!

      By utilizing the built-in sensors of a typical Android phone we try to
      recreate the movement of a boxer. You will be able to throw punches by
      rotating your phone, take cover by tilting it to the back and maybe even
      more.

      or [Tumblr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tumblr)
      except for Jekyll. Seems unfair? Let's change that!

      So how about creating an app that is designed for writing quick markdown
      post directly on your phone and has an integration with GitHub pages?
      Awesome? Awesome!

      nobody remembered to bring the most important equipment: cards!

      What do you do? Pull out your phone, hock it up to the tablet that's lying on the
      table, open the virtual card table app, select the game you want to play
      and off you go!

      The app lets you see which cards have been played on one central screen (e.g. tablet),
      while keeping your hand cards hidden on your phone.

      If you do your daily commute via bike you might have run into this situation:
      almost at work with your head already deep into the challenges for this day
      when **BAAM** you're front tire blows. Normally this isn't a problem *if* you
      have the necessary tools with you, but what if you don't?

      In Germany there is the ADAC when your car breaks down, but what about your bike?
      What if you could use your smartphone to find fellow bikers near you who
      have the tools required to fix up your bike? You could be on your way within
      minutes in stead of having to interrupt family and friends in the middle of their day
      and hope that somebody will pick you up.

      Probably every parent will have come across this at some point in the
      parenting career: having kids is great, but sometimes also a little scary to
      see just how quick they grow up and become adults. If you want to save
      some of those early memories from the toddler age, why not take a picture
      of your loved little one every week and have that compiled into a video
      once your kid reaches a certain age?

      unlock itself once your phone approaches. Could be combined with keeping
      track how many people are inside, who they are and how long they have
      been there (think time tracking for work). Also a nice chance to play
      around with the [Eddystone

      Everybody loves that game where you take out your old Gameboy, invite a
      couple of friends and then go out on a hunt for monsters. Those monsters can then
      be trained and used to compete with others.

      At the same time everybody has heard of the famous game Ingress which brings
      some of that gaming fun to the real (physical!) world.

      What do you think would happen if we were to combine the best of those two
      worlds, such that you can run around your local university and catch those monsters
      right where you stand.

  content: |+
      We have all seen it: you go on a trip with a couple of friends or with
      your colleagues, you see something pretty, everyone takes out their camera
      / smartphone and starts taking pictures. At the end of the day you realize that
      you missed one or two great photo spots and start asking around is somebody
      could provide the missing photos. If somebody is motivated enough you might
      even open up a Dropbox folder where everyone can dump their photos.

      While this works it doesn't feel very smooth and is definitely not
      a lot of fun. Sure we can do better than that in 2015 and make taking photos in
      a group fun and and enjoyable?
