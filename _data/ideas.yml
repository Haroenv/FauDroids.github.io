      Buying ripe fruit in a supermarkt can be a real hassle for red-green color
      blind people. For example choosing a banana that is ready to eat is
      difficult, as the difference between an unripe green banana and a ripe
      yellow one is sometimes very subtle, making it hard to spot a good banana
      with the bare eye.
      
      This app will help red-green color bling people by allowing them to take a
      picture of their fruit and getting told whether or not it is ripe.

      Popular mobile chatting apps all require backends to deliver messages to
      their receivers. This is less than ideal when considering privacy or when
      being caught in a place with little or no network coverage.
      
      By using a peer to peer messenger we could send message between devices
      without letting anyone else every know about what just happened. While it
      might take a little longer for a message to propagate to its destintation,
      it could serve as a valuable addition to existing apps.

      Nowadays virtually everyone you meet has a powerful smartphone right in
      their pocket and we tend to meet a lot of different people over the day.
      What if we would build a game that would trigger some sort of interaction
      whenever two (new) people meet?
      
      In the Distributed Evolution Game everyone has some sort of personal animal
      / monster / pet is living inside smartphones (Tamagotchi anyone?) which can
      evolve over time by exchanging DNA with other people. If done frequently
      enough this would lead to a diverse set of creates which all have different
      abilities and could then compete with one another in various challenges.

      Organ or tissue transplantation can give ill and disabled people the
      chance of a new or better life. The prerequisite is, and always will be,
      that people continue to express their willingness to donate organs and/
      or tissue after their death. We would therefore ask you to think about
      the subject of organ and tissue donation and then reach your own,
      personal decision. &mdash; Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung

      As you just read, donating organs may save other people's lifes. Since organ
      donation prerequisites you to carry an organ donor card with you, I came up
      with the idea to provide an electronic pendant to the classic printed version. 
      
      Since most people own a smartphone, which they happen to carry with them almost
      all the time, it would be great to have an organ donor app which provides a
      lockscreen widget. Using this widget it would be possible to view the organ
      donor card even if the smartphone is locked.

      This is less on the useful and more on the fun / geeky side: imaging
      hooking up multiple smartphones in such a way that they together play a
      tune or song. With a lot of phones connected this could result in a setup
      similar to a real life orchestra where each phone is responsible for
      playing certain notes.

      Another possible way to look at this idea is to simulate a surround sound
      system using multiple phones. While probably not being a replacement for
      a real sound system, it could be a fun party trick with many people
      involved.

      Have you ever wanted to share your current audio / music stream that you
      are listening with people that are in the same network but couldn't
      because there wasn't a link to share? Well, why don't we just forward your audio stream
      directly to your friends?

      This app allows users to create a distributed speaker system, where one
      client controls what music is currently playing and all other phones act
      as speakers which can be spread across multiple rooms.

      Keeping an eye on your total time spent on a subject isn't always easy. 
      Using NFC tags this job could be made much easier.

      Utilizing your mobile as a stamp card you could check-in whenever you start 
      working on a subject by simply placing it on top of an NFC tag.
      As soon as you lift your mobile off the tag, the elapsed time gets measured and stored, 
      giving you an exact overview on how long you've been working on something.

      NOTE: This app requires additional hardware in form of NFC tags.
